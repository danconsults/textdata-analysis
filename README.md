textdata-analysis
=================

This is a project to help me learn more about big data analysis using R. 

As a disclaimer, I'll highly depend on Eric Nguyen's paper on "text mining and network analysis of digital libraies in R"

In this project, I am more interested in text analysis. Text analysis is important especially iwhen carrying out Brand-sentiment analysis . My thesis is that a brand manager can use this algorithms to asses the  market sentiment ion a new product. They can achieve this by scanning social-media and popular forums used by the target market.

As a start, I shall use library data to analyse patterns and text-related information from the dataset. 
This data is ideal because it has Scientific structure, and shall help in clustering information.

Most of the work will also be in learning about text preparation techniques in R.
