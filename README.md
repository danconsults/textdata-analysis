textdata-analysis
=================

This is a project to help me learn more about big data analysis using R. 
In this project, I am more interested in text analysis. Text analysis is important especially iwhen carrying out Brand-sentiment analysis . My thesis is that a brand manager can use this algorithms to asses the  market sentiment ion a new product. They can achieve this by scanning social-media and popular forums used by the target market.
